### Hi there 👋 I'm Shrikar Kaduluri!, aka **Parker2127**! 🕷️🕸️

Ready for a quick tour of my coding universe? 🚀 I'm a **Software Engineer in the making**, fueled by an insatiable passion for Computer Science that keeps me glued to my screen (in a good way, I promise! 😉). With both a **Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science** already under my belt, I've laid a solid foundation for this exciting journey.

My passion lies in prompt engineering and shaping the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). I have hands-on experience developing and refining prompts for conversational AI, leveraging my background in React and JavaScript to understand the user-facing implications of model responses.

I am currently expanding my skill set to include C# and .NET to build robust, full-stack AI applications. My approach combines technical proficiency with a deep appreciation for linguistic nuance, ensuring that AI interactions are not just functional, but also intuitive and effective.

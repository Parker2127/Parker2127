### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shrikar Kaduluri!

Ready for a quick tour of my coding universe? ðŸš€ I'm a **Software Engineer in the making**, fueled by an insatiable passion for Computer Science that keeps me glued to my screen (in a good way, I promise! ðŸ˜‰). With both a **Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science** already under my belt, I've laid a solid foundation for this exciting journey.

My current quest? Conquering the **frontend realm**! I've already honed my skills by building several **React projects**, making pixels dance with **JavaScript**. But I'm not stopping there â€“ I'm also diving deep into the powerful world of **.NET** and **C#**, building a full-stack arsenal. Think of it as mastering both the art of the visible and the magic behind the scenes! âœ¨

And yes, I've even created a special **Git and SSH** repo, because let's be real, who *hasn't* wrestled with those two? ðŸ¥‹ It's my personal "never again" zone, designed to save future me (and maybe you!) from those head-scratching moments.

Exciting updates are brewing, and I can't wait to share my latest adventures and notable achievements. Stay tuned â€“ the journey's just getting started! ðŸŒŸ

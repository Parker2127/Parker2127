### Hi there 👋 I'm Shrikar Kaduluri!, aka **Parker2127**! 🕷️🕸️

As a Technologist with a Master's in Computer Science, I'm passionate about the entire lifecycle of software—from initial development to ensuring a seamless experience for the end-user.

My journey began in Quality Assurance, which gave me a unique, holistic perspective. I learned not only how to build resilient applications but also how to anticipate user needs and troubleshoot complex issues. This foundation drives my work today, whether I'm developing a full-stack application with **React** and **Python** or providing hands-on **IT support** and incident resolution.

My primary focus is on solving problems. I enjoy diving deep into technical challenges, finding the root cause, and providing clear, effective solutions.

In everything I do, I follow a simple policy: **Keep It Super Simple.** This ensures that the systems I help build and support are not just powerful, but also reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly.

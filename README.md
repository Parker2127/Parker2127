### Hi there 👋 I'm Shrikar Kaduluri!, aka **Parker2127**! 🕷️🕸️

Ready for a quick tour of my technical universe? 🚀 I'm an Information Technologist with a Master's degree in Computer Science, fueled by a passion for solving complex problems and ensuring technology empowers people to do their best work.

My primary focus is on **IT support, incident resolution, and managing enterprise systems**. I enjoy diving deep into technical issues, finding the root cause, and providing clear, helpful solutions. My background in software development gives me a unique, end-to-end perspective on how applications are built and supported in the real world. I don't just fix problems; I work to understand the systems to prevent future issues.

My approach combines a strong technical foundation with a user-centric mindset, ensuring that IT systems are not just functional, but also reliable and easy to use.
